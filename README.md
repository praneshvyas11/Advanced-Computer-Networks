This contains the source code for the project done in Advanced Computer Networks course

This Project aims at Designing an algorithm which helps to analyze the topology of the routers at AS level based on BGP updates from a specific vantage 
point. This algorithm gives a clear picture of how many ASâ€™s are present in a given network and analyze growth rate at the AS level with time.
